# LibraryManagementSystem
* Here's a simple Java project using Object-Oriented Programming principles, arrays, and strings. Let's create a Library Management System that manages books and allows users to perform basic operations like adding books, searching for books by title, and displaying all books.

Project Structure
We'll have the following classes:

Book - Represents a book with title, author, and ISBN.
Library - Manages an array of Book objects and allows adding, searching, and displaying books.
LibraryManagementSystem - Contains the main method to interact with the library.
